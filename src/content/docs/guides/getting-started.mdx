## Introduction

**React Awesome Reveal** brings life to your React applications with smooth, performant scroll animations. When elements enter the viewport, they animate into view, creating an engaging and professional user experience.

### Key Benefits

- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Optimized Performance**: Uses the Web Animations API for smooth animations
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive animations that work great on all devices
- **Tree-Shakeable**: Only import what you need to keep your bundle size small

## Installation

Choose your preferred package manager to install React Awesome Reveal and its peer dependency:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    
    ```shell
    npm install react-awesome-reveal @emotion/react
    ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
  
    ```shell
    pnpm add react-awesome-reveal @emotion/react
    ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
  
    ```shell
    yarn add react-awesome-reveal @emotion/react
    ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Basic Usage

Import any animation component and wrap your content. The element will animate when it enters the viewport:

```tsx
import { Fade } from "react-awesome-reveal";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>

      <Fade>
        <p>This content will fade in when scrolled into view</p>
      </Fade>

      {/* Multiple elements will animate together */}
      <Fade cascade>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Feature 1</p>
        <p>Feature 2</p>
        <p>Feature 3</p>
      </Fade>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Customization Options

Customize your animations with these common props:

```tsx
<Fade
  delay={200} // Wait 200ms before starting
  duration={1000} // Animation lasts 1 second
  triggerOnce // Only animate once
  fraction={0.5} // Start animation when element is 50% visible
>
  <p>Customized animation</p>
</Fade>
```
