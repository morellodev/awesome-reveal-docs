Starting from [version 4.3.1](https://github.com/awesome-reveal/react-awesome-reveal/releases/tag/react-awesome-reveal%404.3.1), **React Awesome Reveal** provides out-of-the-box support for [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), making it even easier to use animations in your RSC-powered applications.

## Historical Support

It's worth noting that React Awesome Reveal has always been compatible with React Server Components, but prior to version 4.3.1, it required manual client-side component wrapping. This was because the animation primitives needed access to browser APIs that are only available on the client.

## Modern Usage :badge[v4.3.1+]{variant=success}

With version 4.3.1 and above, you can use animation primitives directly in your RSC components without any additional setup. Simply import and use them:

```tsx
// app/features.tsx
import { Slide } from "react-awesome-reveal";

async function getFeatures() {
  // ...
}

export default async function Features() {
  const features = await getFeatures();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Our Features</h2>

      <Slide direction="up" cascade triggerOnce>
        {features.map((feature) => (
          <div key={feature.id} className="feature-card">
            {feature.content}
          </div>
        ))}
      </Slide>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Legacy Usage :badge[pre-4.3.1]{variant=caution}

Before version 4.3.1, you needed to create client-side wrapper components for each animation primitive you wanted to use. This involved:

1. Creating a separate component file
2. Adding the `"use client"` directive
3. Re-exporting the animation primitive

Here's how it looked:

```tsx
// components/Slide.tsx
"use client";

import { Slide as SlidePrimitive, type SlideProps } from "react-awesome-reveal";

function Slide(props: SlideProps) {
  return <SlidePrimitive {...props} />;
}

export default Slide;
```

Then using it in your components:

```tsx
// app/features.tsx
import Slide from "./components/Slide";

export default async function Features() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Our Features</h2>

      <Slide direction="up" cascade triggerOnce>
        {features.map((feature) => (
          <div key={feature.id} className="feature-card">
            {feature.content}
          </div>
        ))}
      </Slide>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The new version eliminates this boilerplate while maintaining full compatibility with React Server Components. We recommend upgrading to version 4.3.1 or later to take advantage of this simplified usage.
